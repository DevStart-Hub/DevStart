# What is this?

DevStart is an online hands-on manual for anyone who is approaching developmental psychology and developmental cognitive neuroscience for the first time, from master's students and PhDs to postdocs. 

Assuming no a priori knowledge, this website will guide you through your first steps as a developmental researcher. You'll find many examples and guidelines on how to grasp the basic principles of developmental psychology research, design and set up a study with different research methods, analyse data, and start programming.

## Core principles

DevStart is built on three guiding principles that reflect our approach to developmental research.

We're committed to open source tools and aim to only use software that is freely available to everyone. Academia is already difficult enough without financial barriers - we want to reduce the impact of money on research and ensure that good science isn't limited by budget constraints.

Our resources are completely free to use because we believe knowledge should be accessible to all researchers regardless of their funding situation.

Most importantly, we see ourselves as a knowledge hub rather than the authority on "best practices." We don't have all the answers, just hard-earned solutions from our own research journeys. What worked for us might need tweaking for you, and we welcome those contributions. After all, developmental research is as much about collaboration as it is about discovery.

## Why did we create it?

There are many resources on the web to learn how to program, build experiments, and analyse data. However, they often assume basic skills in programming, and they don't tackle the challenges that we encounter when testing babies and young children. This knowledge is often handed down from Professors and Postdocs to PhD students, or it is acquired through hours and hours of despair. 

We tried to summarize all the struggles that we encountered during our PhDs and the solutions we came up with. With this website, we aim to offer you a solution to overcome these problems, and we invite anyone to help us and contribute to this open science framework!

## How to contribute?

If you're an expert on a specific topic and you want to change something or add something, if you don't agree with our pipeline, or you spot an error in our code, please get in touch!

This is a story of bullying and love started in 2018 at the Donders Institute in the Netherlands. Tommaso and Francesco were living their best PhD life when Giulia bumped into them, looking for data to write her master's thesis.

United by a strong passion for research and a creepy attraction to complex and noisy datasets, they immediately got along well. We haven't stopped collaborating since then.



## Warnings!

We tried our best to offer the best and most accurate solutions. However, do always check the code and if the outputs make sense. Please get in touch if you spot any errors.

We apologize in advance for our poor coding skills. Our scripts are not perfect, and they don't mean to be. But, as Francesco always says, they work! And we hope they will support you during your PhD.
